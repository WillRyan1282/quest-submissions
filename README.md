Day Two Quest

	1) What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
		
		Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programing.
		
	2) In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
		 
		 Safety is a best practice in most is not all situations and fields but when handling information, money, and assets it's important to be safe. Clarity 	      helps provide safety with ease of understanding and helps eliminate mistakes. Approachability so development can come quick and efficiently. Developer      		Experience is a best practice going forward in a competitive marketplace. Providing quality UX is key to attracting users and in this case programmers.
